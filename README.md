## Replication
I worked in two different enviroments. The idea was also to look at the difference between a controlled envinroment (UNITN Cluster) and a more realistic one (Ubuntu VM). I decided to work on Ubuntu and not on Windows (the native OS of my machine) beacuse the simplicity of using C compilers there.

### Ubuntu VM
The version of gcc used to compile here is 11

### UNITN Cluster
The version of gcc used to compile here is 9.1
